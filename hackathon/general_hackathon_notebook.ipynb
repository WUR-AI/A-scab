    "# 🍏 Welcome to the **Smart Droplets Hackathon**!\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](assets/sd_logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smart Droplets project is an EU-funded project, focusing on achieving reduced pesticide and fertilizer use with techniques of Digital Twins and Reinforcement Learning. One of the pilot projects of Smart Droplets is about the reduction of the **apple scab** pest.\n",
    "In commercial apple production, **apple scab (_Venturia inaequalis_)** is the most economically important disease. Growers traditionally rely on **calendar-based fungicide programs**, which can lead to unnecessary sprays, resistance, and environmental impact.\n",
    "In this hackathon we’ll flip that paradigm: **you will train a reinforcement-learning (RL) agent, or an intelligent conditional agent, to decide _when_ (and _how much_) to spray, balancing disease risk with sustainability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: **Learn an optimal and adaptive spraying policy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to achieve that?**: Use **RL** to interact with the **A-scab** disease simulator. Your agent chooses daily actions (“spray how much” vs. “don’t spray”) through an entire season, to reduce the risk of breakout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this important?** Smarter timing reduces chemical use, lowers costs, and lowers environmental impact while keeping orchards healthy to reduce yield loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success is measured by a **cumulative reward**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_t = - Risk_{t} - \\beta P_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Risk$ is **Infection risk** – cumulative infection severity at harvest\n",
    "* $\\beta$ is **trade-off coefficient** - coefficient describing economic and ecological price of pesticides\n",
    "* $P$ is **Pesticide amount** – the amount of pesticide sprayed\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher score is better -- closer to zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌱 The Environment: **Ascabgym**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascabgym is a stochastic, weather-driven model of apple scab dynamics, based on the A-scab model.\n",
    "At each daily time step, an agent can observe the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Weather features_: Temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness\n",
    "    * also 1 day and 2 day forecasts of the above weather features\n",
    "* _Pest features_: ascopore maturity & development\n",
    "* _Tree features_: leaf area index and phenology\n",
    "\n",
    "…and updates disease progress based on your action. We expose a **Gymnasium-style API** so you can plug in any RL library (Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, CleanRL, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Data & Starter Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Historical weather files** for training the model, files from several locations in Europe (CSV).\n",
    "* **Default orchard parameters** which are already embedded in the model\n",
    "* Performance of baseline agents to beat!\n",
    "\n",
    "% Clone the repo or fork the Kaggle notebook, pip-install extra libraries as needed, and start experimenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏆 Evaluation & Leaderboards\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local validation** – run episodes on the provided weather years (fast iteration).\n",
    "2. **Public leaderboard** – on submission, Kaggle simulates **four hidden seasons** from a particular location and reveals your average score.\n",
    "3. **Private leaderboard** (final ranking) – after the deadline we evaluate on **five additional unseen seasons** to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Aim for generalisation, not leaderboard-hacking!\n",
