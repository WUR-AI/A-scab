    Implementation of Infection model from Rossi et al., figure 2

    The model describes the progression of spores deposited on an apple tree.
    Spores advance through three successive stages, represented by sigmoids that indicate the proportion of spores at each stage.
    Spores may die; mortality is determined by weather conditions
    The risk of infection is determined by the number of spores that survive to the third stage.

    The original model seems a bit ambiguous at some points, especially eq. 24.
    The following assumptions are done:
    * Host susceptibility (HOST_inf in eq. 24) is ignored as computation of LAI development is questionable
      (i.e. eq. 23 yields negative values when LAI>0.125)
    * The length of the infection period is computed as the hours of wetness (t_inf) p304, starting at midnight
      Start of the infection is set to the discharge_hour (i.e. not start at midnight (!))
    * Risk for a whole infection period is calculated as follows:
      (1) determine the number of spores in stage 3 each hour
      (2) take the value at the end of the day (i.e. not at the end of the infection period, as Rossi may intend (!))
      (3) sum all end-of-day-values in infection period
    (!) Note that the sigmoids of stage3 may not have reached to 100% yet, as infection duration is not a variable in these sigmoids

    Mortality is computed as follows (for each hour):
      (1) The distribution of spores over the stages (i.e. fractions) is computed under a no-mortality assumption
      (2) The stage-specific mortality is computed
      (3) Stage-specific mortality (i.e. (2)) is multiplied with the fraction of that stage (i.e. (1)), resulting in total death
      (4) The population that died is subtracted from the population that has survived

    A similar approach is taken for the deposition of spores (for each hour):
      (1) Determine the fraction that will be released
      (2) Determine the fraction that will not be deposited
      (3) Multiply (1) and (2) to obtain the amount that will be lost; subtract from population that has survived

    Incubation period is not implemented (yet) as that won't influence end result
